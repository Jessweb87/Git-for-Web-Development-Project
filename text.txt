    2.  Add your TL (me) as a collaborator on your forked Repo.
    3. Clone your Repo using githubs 'Clone or download' button
    4. Back inside your CLI, use the cd command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer)
    5. Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in.
    6. cd into the newly created repo using the cd <repo-name> command
    7. Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on)
    8. 10. To add and commit changes on your branch you can do the following
- **git add .** will add the repo changes and make them ready for committing
- **git commit -m "Your helpful commit message here"** will commit the changes with your specified commit message (commit message should explain what changes you've added to the repo that you are committing)
    9.Push your changes back up to your Github repo
    10. Now that the changes are on github you can submit a PR (Pull Request)
13. Go back to your forked Project repo on github (make sure you are on YOUR FORKED copy NOT the original Lambda one)
- Click on the **Branch:master** button on the left side (see picture)
- This will create a dropdown where you should be able to select your name-branch now
- Click your name-branch and then click the **New pull request** button to make a pull request on your name branch
- After you click new pull request it should redirect you to the pull request page
- IT IS IMPOTANT THAT YOU DO NOT CLICK THE **Create pull request** BUTTON UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED THE NEXT STEP
14. - When you get to the PR page, make sure to click the dropdown button that says **base repository** and CHANGE it to be your FORKED REPO instead of the original Lambda repo (when submitting PR it will default to the original Repo this is why it needs to be changed)
